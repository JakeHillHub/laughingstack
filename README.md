# laughingstack
Literally just a bunch of ways how programmers laugh in various languages.

I suggest to contribute, please.

You can add any programming language as long there exists a compiler / interpreter / a way to test it.

You can help add any way of writing "hahaha" in any programming or scripting language (somehow HTML got into this as well thinking it's a programming language).

This can be anything from creating 67 threads to calculate the 379 millionth digit of pi which somehow writes out "hahaha", to the most boring `print("hahaha")`.

## Notes when contributing
If you don't know the version of the language, just add it to the main language folder. IF you know the version, please add it to the corresponding version folder of the specific language folder.

If it's a whole project, let's say you have made an entire 3D world that somehow generates the letters "hahaha", then create a project folder under the corresponding programming language and version. If more than one language is used, put it under the project's main programming language folder and correct version.
A project folder could be named something like this:
```
{project-name}-{github-username}
```
This way we may not end up with any conflicts.
