# laughingstack
Literally just a bunch of ways how programmers laugh in various languages.

I suggest to contribute, please.

You can add any programming language as long there exists a compiler / interpreter.

You can help add any way of writing "hahaha" in any programming or scripting language.

This can be anything from creating 67 threads to calculate the 379 millionth digit of pi which somehow comes writes out "hahaha" to the most boring `print("hahaha")`.

If you don't know the version of the language, just add it to the main language folder. IF you know the version, please add it to the corresponding version folder of the specific language folder.
